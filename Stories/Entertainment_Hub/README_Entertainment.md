# Everybody Codes - Echoes of Enigmatus

## Day-by-Day Coding Overview

1. **Quest 1 - Nail Down Your Luck**: Simple slot machine puzzle, that requires you to follow fairly simple set of rules. Couple of tricky steps, with how to handle the starting and final slots, but overall nothing too tricky. Part 3 was kind of interesting but scipy, simplified it. Potential for a playable game to be created with some visualization.
2. **Quest 2 - The Pocket-Money Popper**: As is the tradition with most coding problems, this was a fairly simple logic whose complexity grew as you increased the numbers, and especially became tricky to track a changing memory. Which i did by making it a binary choice to keep track of which balloons blew up or not, but ultimately the opposite balloon stumped me for too long, until i found a missing minus sign to solve my troubles.
