## Day-by-Day Coding Overview

1. **Day 1 - Whispers in the Shell**: Fairly simple challenges for list indexing and manipulation.
2. **Day 2 - From Complex to Clarity**: Vector Math, fairly simple execution once you get over the hurdle of integer and div math.
3. **Day 3 - The Deepest Fit**: Why write your own functions, when python can do it for you. LEARN PYTHON Kids
4. **Day 4 - Teeth of the Wind**: MATH IS FUN
5. **Day 5 - Fishbone Order**: Interesting way to build a tree fairly simple overall, but figuring out how to skip over segments took a bit of time.
